# Welcome to My Digital Space

Hi there! I'm Petre-Alexandru Hautelman, a Romanian software developer currently living in the Netherlands. This is my corner of the internet where I share knowledge, explore ideas, and showcase the projects that keep me excited about the ever-evolving world of tech.

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing my **MSc in Artificial Intelligence Technology** at TU Delft (2023 - Present), building upon my **BSc in Computer Science and Engineering** from the same institution (2019 - 2023, 7.58 GPA). My academic journey has taken me through fascinating territories including big data processing, computational intelligence, quantum information, and collaborative AI.

During my bachelor's, I conducted research on **"An empirical analysis of entropy search in batch bayesian optimisation"** - a project that deepened my appreciation for the intersection of theory and practical application in machine learning optimization.

Professionally, I work as a **Software Developer at Kinaxis** in Rotterdam, where I'm part of a dynamic team designing and optimizing software solutions for supply chain management, logistics, and transportation. My daily toolkit includes Java Spring, SQL, and modern web technologies, all while embracing agile methodologies and test-driven development practices.

## What Drives Me

I'm passionate about **algorithmics and data science**, always seeking that perfect balance between elegant code and impactful results. As a curious perfectionist, I thrive in collaborative environments where innovative solutions meet real-world challenges. My appetite for learning is insatiable - there's always a new technology to explore, a better approach to discover, or an optimization to uncover.

Nothing makes me happier than seeing people developing best quality software and witnessing others use software that enhances their power, productivity, and life enjoyment. This belief drives me to advocate for and develop **open-source software** whenever possible - because I believe great tools should be accessible to everyone.

I'm on a mission to **make state-of-the-art AI available to everyone** - both developers and non-technical users alike. Technology should empower, not exclude, and I'm committed to building bridges that make cutting-edge AI tools accessible and usable for people from all backgrounds.
